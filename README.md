MotionPlusVideoSeen
===================
This homebrew sets the "MPLS.MOVIE" flag in SYSCONF that tells the Wii if the user has already seen the "Wii Motion Plus" tutorial video.

Start the application and it tells you the current status.
* Press "A" to change the status
* Press "HOME" to exit without changing

It also works on the Wii U.

## Installation
1. Grab the ZIP from the [releases page](https://github.com/WiiDatabase/MotionPlusVideoSeen/releases)
2. Extract it to the root of your SD card, so that you have the path "SD://apps/MotionPlusVideoSeen/boot.dol"
3. Run the homebrew through the homebrew channel and follow the on-screen instructions
